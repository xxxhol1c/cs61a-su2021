:tada: This course is designed for the beginners who don't have any foundation of CS.  

:eyes: All questions, including optional ones and extra credit, have been completed.  

:wink: All the solutions are reference only. Hopefully these can help you.  

:dizzy: You can goto https://cs61a.org/ to find official ones. But at the end of each semester, the solution page will be unavailable. :closed_lock_with_key:  

:wave:  My WSl crashed unexpectedly, so I reupload it. SEE YA!
